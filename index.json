However, scRNA-seq data suffer from problems of extremely high dropout rate and cell-to-cell variability, demanding new methods to recover gene expression loss. Despite the availability of various dropout imputation approaches for scRNA-seq, most studies focus on data with a medium or large number of cells, while few studies have explicitly investigated the differential performance across different sample sizes or the applicability of the approach on small or imbalanced data. It is imperative to develop new imputation approaches with higher generalizability for data with various sample sizes.We proposed a method called scHinter for imputing dropout events for scRNA-seq with special emphasis on data with limited sample size. scHinter incorporates a voting-based ensemble distance and leverages the synthetic minority oversampling technique for random interpolation. A hierarchical framework is also embedded in scHinter to increase the reliability of the imputation for small samples. We demonstrated the ability of scHinter to recover gene expression measurements across a wide spectrum of scRNA-seq datasets with varied sample sizes. We comprehensively examined the impact of sample size and cluster number on imputation. Comprehensive evaluation of scHinter across diverse scRNA-seq datasets with imbalanced or limited sample size showed that scHinter achieved higher and more robust performance than competing approaches, including MAGIC, scImpute, SAVER and netSmooth.Freely available for download at https://github.com/BMILAB/scHinter.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","tags":null,"title":"scHinter: imputing dropout events for single-cell RNA-seq data with limited sample size","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael A.

However, owing to the unique statistical properties of scRNA-seq data, the optimal measures of association for identifying gene–gene and cell–cell relationships from single-cell transcriptomics remain unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of 17 measures of association for their ability to reconstruct cellular networks, cluster cells of the same type and link cell-type-specific transcriptional programs to disease. Measures of proportionality were consistently among the best-performing methods across datasets and tasks.

One approach to the problem is to perform a power analysis for a univariate objective such as differential expression. However, many of the goals of single-cell analysis requires consideration of the multivariate structure of gene expression, such as clustering. We introduce an approach to quantifying the impact of sequencing depth and cell number on the estimation of a multivariate generative model for gene expression that is based on error analysis in the framework of a variational autoencoder. We find that at shallow depths, the marginal benefit of deeper sequencing per cell significantly outweighs the benefit of increased cell numbers. Above about 15,000 reads per cell the benefit of increased sequencing depth is minor.

However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse scRNA-seq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a negative binomial noise model with or without zero-inflation, and nonlinear gene-gene dependencies are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can, therefore, be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.","tags":null,"title":"Single-cell RNA-seq denoising using a deep count autoencoder","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"04ab7b4b64700f12de495839014dec11","permalink":"https://Treppner.github.io/publication/noauthor-sajita-2018/","publishdate":"2020-04-12T12:39:22.441861Z","relpermalink":"/publication/noauthor-sajita-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sajita Lab -

The corresponding vast amounts of mostly unlabeled data pose a challenge to statistical modeling approaches. To investigate the feasibility of deep learning approaches for unsupervised learning with such data, we examine weekly usage patterns of Fitbit activity trackers with deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs). This method is particularly suitable for modeling complex joint distributions via latent variables. We also chose this specific procedure because it is a generative approach, i.e., artificial samples can be generated to explore the learned structure. We describe how the data can be preprocessed to be compatible with binary DBMs. The results reveal two distinct usage patterns in which one group frequently uses trackers on Mondays and Tuesdays, whereas the other uses trackers during the entire week. This exemplary result shows that DBMs are feasible and can be useful for modeling activity tracker data.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Activity Tracker Data Using Deep Boltzmann Machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin J.
